        ACM SAC 2015

For the past thirty years, the ACM Symposium on Applied
Computing has been a primary gathering forum for applied computer
scientists, computer engineers, software engineers, and application
developers from around the world. SAC 2015 is sponsored by the ACM
Special Interest Group on Applied Computing (SIGAPP), and is held at 
Salamanca (Spain).


        SOAP TRACK: CALL FOR PAPERS

Service-Oriented Programming (SOP) is quickly changing our vision of 
software development, bringing a paradigmatic shift in the methodologies 
followed  by programmers when designing and implementing distributed 
systems. SOP originally triggered a radical transformation of the Web, 
from  being a means  of presenting information to a wide spectrum of people
to becoming a computational fabric. In such fabric, loosely-coupled services 
publish their interfaces and,  through them, discover and interact with each 
other abstracting from their internal  implementations. While this 
transformation still continues today, it has also already generated other 
shifts in how programmers deal with  resource handling (Cloud Computing) and 
the scalability of software  architectures from the very small to the very 
large (Microservices).  Research on SOP is giving strong impetus to the 
development of new  technologies and tools for creating and deploying 
distributed software. In the context of this modern paradigm we have to 
cope with an old challenge, like in the early days of  Object-Oriented 
Programming (OOP) when, until key features like  encapsulation, inheritance, 
and polymorphism, and proper design  methodologies were defined, consistency 
in the programming model definition was not achieved. The complex scenario of 
SOP needs to be  clarified on many aspects, both from the engineering and 
from the foundational points of view.

From the engineering point of view, there are open issues at many 
levels. Among others, at the system design level, both traditional 
approaches based on UML and approaches taking inspiration from 
business process modelling, e.g. BPMN, are used. At the composition 
level, orchestration and choreography are continuously improved both 
formally and practically, with an evident need for their integration in 
the development process. At the description and discovery level there are 
two separate communities pushing respectively the semantic approach (ontologies, 
OWL, ...) and the syntactic one like WSDL. In  particular, the role of discovery 
engines and protocols is not clear.  In this respect we still lack adopted 
standards: UDDI looked to be a  good candidate, but it is no longer pushed by 
the main corporations, and its wide adoption seems difficult. Furthermore, a new 
implementation platform, the so-called REST services, is emerging and 
competing with classic Web Services. Finally, features like Quality 
of Service, security and dependability need to be taken seriously 
into account, and this investigation should lead to standard 
proposals.

From the foundational point of view, formalists have discussed widely
in the last years, and many attempts to use formal methods for 
specification and verification in this setting have been made. 
Session correlation, service types, contract theories and 
communication patterns are only a few examples of the aspects that 
have been investigated. Moreover, several formal models based upon 
automata, Petri nets and algebraic approaches have been developed. 
However most of these approaches concentrate only on a few features 
of Service-Oriented Systems in isolation, and a comprehensive approach 
is still far from being achieved.

Our track aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners 
having the common objective of transforming SOP into a mature 
discipline with both solid scientific foundations and mature 
software engineering development methodologies supported by dedicated
tools. In particular, we will encourage works and discussions about 
what SOP still needs in order to achieve its original goal.


Major topics of interest will include:

Formal methods for Service-Oriented Computing
Notations, models, and standards for Service-Oriented Computing
Tools and Middlewares for Service-Oriented Development

Microservices and Scalable Service-Oriented Computing
Engineering methodologies and Patterns for Service-Oriented Software
Static Analysis and Testing of Service-Oriented applications
Adaptability, Dependability, and Fault handling in Service Systems
Security in Service-Oriented Architectures
Quality of Service and Performance Analysis
Industrial deployment of tools and methodologies, case studies
Service application case studies
Trust and Services
Sustainability and Services, Green Computing
Cloud Computing and Services
Services and Big Data




        SUBMISSIONS

Authors are invited to submit original unpublished papers. Submission
of the same paper to multiple tracks is not allowed. Peer groups with
expertise in the track focus area will double-blindly review
submissions. Accepted papers will be published in the annual
conference proceedings. SOAP track chairs will not submit to the
track. Submissions from SOAP PC members and from PC members and track
chairs of other SAC tracks are welcome. Submission guidelines
can be found on SAC 2015 Website:
    
	http://www.acm.org/conferences/sac/sac2015/

The submission web-link (START system) for regular papers is 

http://www.acm.org/conferences/sac/sac2015/Paper-SubmissionUploadPage.htm

Prospective papers should be submitted to the track using the provided
automated submission system. Please pay attention to ensure anonymity
of your submitted manuscript as detailed in the submission page so to
allow for double-blind review. Papers not satisfying this constraint
will be automatically rejected. The maximum length for papers is 8
pages. Accepted papers whose camera-ready version will exceed 6 pages
will have to pay an extra charge. 

Paper registration is required, allowing the inclusion of the paper/poster
in the conference proceedings. An author or a proxy attending SAC MUST present
the paper. This is a requirement for the paper/poster to be included
in the ACM/IEEE digital library. No-show of scheduled papers and posters
will result in excluding them from the ACM/IEEE digital library.


        SPECIAL ISSUE

We plan to organize one or two special issues depending on the quality of
the submissions. Best papers will be invited to a special issue of Elsevier’s
Science of Computer Programming 

http://www.journals.elsevier.com/science-of-computer-programming/

Best papers by young researchers will be invited to a special issue of the 
Journal of Internet Services and Information Security

http://www.jisis.org/


        STUDENT RESEARCH COMPETITION PROGRAM 

Graduate students are invited to submit research abstracts (minimum of
2-page and maximum of 4-page) following the instructions published at
SAC 2014 website. Submission of the same abstract to multiple tracks
is not allowed. All research abstract submissions will be reviewed by
researchers and practitioners with expertise in the track focus area
to which they are submitted. Authors of selected abstracts will have
the opportunity to give poster presentations of their work and compete
for three top-winning places. The Student Research Competition
committee will evaluate and select First-, Second-, and Third- place
winners. The winners will receive cash awards and SIGAPP recognition
certificates during the conference banquet. Authors of selected
abstracts are eligible to apply to the SIGAPP Student Travel Award
program for support.
