For the past thirty years, the ACM
Symposium on Applied Computing has been a
primary gathering forum for applied computer
scientists, computer engineers, software engineers,
and application developers from around the world.
<a href="http://www.acm.org/conferences/sac/sac2015/" target="_new">SAC 2015</a> is sponsored by the ACM Special
Interest Group on Applied Computing (SIGAPP),
and will be held in Salamanca, Spain.

<div class="SectionContent">

Service-Oriented Programming (SOP) is quickly changing our vision of 
software development, bringing a paradigmatic shift in the methodologies followed 
by programmers when designing and implementing distributed systems.
SOP originally triggered a radical transformation of the Web, from being a means of presenting information to a wide spectrum of people to becoming a computational fabric. In such fabric, loosely-coupled services publish their interfaces and, through them, discover and interact with each other abstracting from their internal implementations.
While this transformation still continues today, it has also already generated other shifts in how programmers deal with resource handling (Cloud Computing) and the scalability of software architectures from the very small to the very large (Microservices).
Research on SOP is giving strong impetus to the 
development of new technologies and tools for creating and deploying 
distributed software. In the context of this modern paradigm we have 
to cope with an old challenge, like in the early days of 
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) when, until key features like 
encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, and proper design 
methodologies were defined, consistency in the programming model 
definition was not achieved. The complex scenario of SOP needs to be 
clarified on many aspects, both from the engineering and from the 
foundational points of view.<br/><br/>

From the engineering point of view, there are open issues at many 
levels. Among others, at the system design level, both traditional 
approaches based on UML and approaches taking inspiration from 
business process modelling, e.g. BPMN, are used. At the composition 
level, orchestration and choreography are continuously improved both formally and practically, with an evident need for their integration in the development process. At the description and discovery level there are two separate communities pushing respectively the semantic approach (ontologies, OWL, ...) and the syntactic one like WSDL. In 
particular, the role of discovery engines and protocols is not clear. 
In this respect we still lack adopted standards: UDDI looked to be a 
good candidate, but it is no longer pushed by the main corporations, 
and its wide adoption seems difficult. Furthermore, a new 
implementation platform, the so-called REST services, is emerging and 
competing with classic Web Services. Finally, features like Quality 
of Service, security and dependability need to be taken seriously 
into account, and this investigation should lead to standard 
proposals.<br/><br/>

From the foundational point of view, formalists have discussed widely
in the last years, and many attempts to use formal methods for 
specification and verification in this setting have been made. 
Session correlation, service types, contract theories and 
communication patterns are only a few examples of the aspects that 
have been investigated. Moreover, several formal models based upon 
automata, Petri nets and algebraic approaches have been developed. 
However most of these approaches concentrate only on a few features 
of Service-Oriented Systems in isolation, and a comprehensive approach 
is still far from being achieved.

Our track aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners 
having the common objective of transforming SOP into a mature 
discipline with both solid scientific foundations and mature 
software engineering development methodologies supported by dedicated
tools. In particular, we will encourage works and discussions about 
what SOP still needs in order to achieve its original goal.<br/><br/>

<div class="SectionContent">
<p>
Authors are invited to submit original unpublished papers. Submission
of the same paper to multiple tracks is not allowed. Peer groups with
expertise in the track focus area will double-blindly review
submissions. Accepted papers will be published in the annual
conference proceedings. SOAP track chairs will not submit to the
track. Submissions from SOAP PC members and from PC members and track
chairs of other SAC tracks are welcome. Submission guidelines
can be found on the
<a href="http://www.acm.org/conferences/sac/sac2015/" target="_new">SAC 2015 website</a>.
Prospective papers should be submitted to the track using the provided
automated submission system. Please pay attention to ensure anonimity
of your submitted manuscript as detailed in the submission page so to
allow for double-blind review. Papers not satisfying this constraint
will be automatically rejected. The maximum length for papers is 8
pages. Accepted papers whose camera-ready version will exceed 6 pages
will have to pay an extra charge.  For each accepted paper, an author
or a proxy attending SAC MUST present the paper. This is a requirement
for the paper to be included in the ACM/IEEE digital library.
</p>
<p>
Paper registration is required, allowing the inclusion of the paper/poster in the conference proceedings.
An author or a proxy attending SAC MUST present the paper. This is a requirement for the paper/poster to be included in the ACM/IEEE digital library.
No-show of scheduled papers and posters will result in excluding them from the ACM/IEEE digital library.</p>

<div class="SectionContent">
Graduate students are invited to submit research abstracts (minimum of
2-page and maximum of 4-page) following the instructions published at
SAC 2014 website. Submission of the same abstract to multiple tracks
is not allowed. All research abstract submissions will be reviewed by

the opportunity to give poster presentations of their work and compete
for three top-winning places. The Student Research Competition
committee will evaluate and select First-, Second-, and Third- place
winners. The winners will receive cash awards and SIGAPP recognition
certificates during the conference banquet. Authors of selected
abstracts are eligible to apply to the SIGAPP Student Travel Award
program for support.<br/><br/>
