        ACM SAC & MIDOS TRACK 2019
        
For the past thirty years, the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing has been a
primary gathering forum for applied computer scientists, computer engineers,
software engineers, and application developers from around the world. MiDOS is
the first edition focusing on Microservices, DevOps, and Service-Oriented
Architecture and it is the natural continuation of the previous Service-Oriented
Architecture and Programming (SOAP) track, now discontinued.


        MiDOS TRACK: CALL FOR PAPERS

Service-oriented architectures have changed our vision of the Web, bringing a
paradigmatic shift in the methodologies when designing and implementing
distributed systems. Originally, the Web was mainly seen as a means of
presenting information to a wide spectrum of people, but service-oriented
programming triggered a radical transformation of the Web towards a
computational fabric where loosely coupled services interact, can be discovered
and then invoked. More recently, the microservices architectural style has been
proposed, where applications are developed as a collection of fine-grained
services running as independent processes. Distributed applications can then be
constructed from independently deployable services taking advantage of the
properties of the microservice architecture (e.g., flexibility, maintainability,
reusability, compositionality, and scalability) as well as the elasticity of
cloud infrastructure. From the practical point of view, the deployment and
maintenance of (micro)services architectures is performed using DevOps, i.e.,  a
collection of practices linking software development (Dev) with software
operations (Ops). DevOps strongly advocates for automation and monitoring at all
steps of software construction, from integration, testing, releasing to
deployment and infrastructure management. By using the DevOps methodology, it is
possible to reduce the time between committing a change to a system and the
change being placed into normal production, while ensuring high quality.

The complex scenario of (Micro)Services and DevOps needs to be clarified on many
aspects, both from the engineering and from the foundational points of
view. 

Our track aims to bring together researchers and practitioners having the common
objective of transforming Service-Oriented, DevOps, and Microservice practices
into a mature discipline with both solid scientific foundations and mature
software engineering development methodologies supported by dedicated tools. In
particular, we will encourage works and discussions about what (Micro)Services
and DevOps still need in order to achieve their goal.

        SUBMISSIONS

Authors are invited to submit original unpublished papers. Submission
of the same paper to multiple tracks is not allowed. Peer groups with
expertise in the track focus area will double-blindly review submissions. 
Accepted papers will be published in the annual conference proceedings. 

Submission guidelines can be found on the SAC 2019 website:
    
	http://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2019/

Prospective papers should be submitted to the track using the provided
automated submission system. Please pay attention to ensure anonymity
of your submitted manuscript as detailed in the submission page so to
allow for double-blind review. Papers not satisfying this constraint
will be automatically rejected. The maximum length for papers is 10
pages. Accepted papers whose camera-ready version will exceed 8 pages
will have to pay an extra charge. 

For each accepted paper, a registration is required, allowing the inclusion of
the paper/poster in the conference proceedings. An author or a proxy attending
SAC MUST present the paper. This is a requirement for the paper/poster to be
included in the ACM digital library. No-show of registered papers and posters
will result in excluding them from the ACM digital library.


        STUDENT TRAVEL AWARD PROGRAM 

SIGAPP student members can apply for financial support to present their accepted
work at SAC via the SIGAPP Student Travel Award Program
(https://www.sigapp.org/stawards.html). 


        SPECIAL ISSUE

We plan a special issue of a top-level journal for which we will invite 
the best papers.
