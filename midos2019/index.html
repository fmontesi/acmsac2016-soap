			For the past thirty years, the <a

			scientists, computer engineers, software engineers, and application developers
			from around the world. MiDOS is the first edition focusing on Microservices,
			DevOps, and Service-Oriented Architecture and it is the natural continuation of
			the previous Service-Oriented Architecture and Programming (SOAP) track, now

			Service-oriented architectures have changed our vision of the Web,
			bringing a paradigmatic shift in the methodologies when designing and
			implementing distributed systems. Originally, the Web was mainly seen as a
			means of presenting information to a wide spectrum of people, but
			service-oriented programming triggered a radical transformation of the Web
			towards a computational fabric where loosely coupled services interact,
			can be discovered and then invoked. More recently, the microservices
			architectural style has been proposed, where applications are developed as
			a collection of fine-grained services running as independent processes.
			Distributed applications can then be constructed from independently
			deployable services taking advantage of the properties of the microservice
			architecture (e.g., flexibility, maintainability, reusability,
			compositionality, and scalability) as well as the elasticity of cloud
			infrastructure. From the practical point of view, the deployment and
			maintenance of (micro)services architectures is performed using DevOps,
			i.e., a collection of practices linking software development (Dev) with
			software operations (Ops). DevOps strongly advocates for automation and
			monitoring at all steps of software construction, from integration,
			testing, releasing to deployment and infrastructure management. By using
			the DevOps methodology, it is possible to reduce the time between
			committing a change to a system and the change being placed into normal
			production, while ensuring high quality.
			<br /><br />

			The complex scenario of (Micro)Services and DevOps needs to be clarified
			on many aspects, both from the engineering and from the foundational
			points of view. 
			<br /><br />

			Our track aims to bring together researchers and practitioners having the
			common objective of transforming Service-Oriented, DevOps, and
			Microservice practices into a mature discipline with both solid scientific
			foundations and mature software engineering development methodologies
			supported by dedicated tools. In particular, we will encourage works and
			discussions about what (Micro)Services and DevOps still need in order to
			achieve their goal.

		Authors are invited to submit original unpublished papers. Submission of the
		same paper to multiple tracks is not allowed. Peer groups with expertise in
		the track focus area will <b>double-blindly</b> review submissions. This
		means that authors must omit their names and institutions from the title
		page, they should refer to their other work in the third person and omit
		acknowledgements that could reveal their identity or affiliation.
		Anonymization should not be a heavy burden for authors, and should not make
		papers weaker or more difficult to review. Advertising the paper on
		alternate forums (e.g., on a personal web-page, pre-print archive, email,
		talks, discussions with colleagues) is permitted, and authors will not be
		penalized by for such advertisement. Papers not satisfying this constraint
		will be automatically rejected.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		Accepted papers will be published in the annual conference proceedings.
		Submission guidelines can be found on the <a
		href="https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2019/downloads.html" target="_new">SAC
		2019 website</a>. Prospective papers should be submitted to the track using
		the provided automated submission available at the <a
		href="https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2019/submission.html">SAC 2019
		submission site</a>. See the SAC site for the page constraints. For each
		accepted paper, an author or a proxy attending SAC MUST present the paper.
		This is a requirement for the paper to be included in the ACM/IEEE digital
		library.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		For each accepted paper, a registration is required, allowing the inclusion
		of the paper/poster in the conference proceedings. An author or a proxy
		attending SAC MUST present the paper. This is a requirement for the
		paper/poster to be included in the ACM digital library. No-show of
		registered papers and posters will result in excluding them from the ACM
		digital library.
