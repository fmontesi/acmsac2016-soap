	    Service-oriented architectures have changed our vision of the Web, bringing a paradigmatic shift in the methodologies when designing and implementing distributed systems. Originally, the Web was mainly seen as a means of presenting information to a wide spectrum of people, but service-oriented programming triggered a radical transformation of the Web towards a computational fabric where loosely coupled services interact, can be discovered and then invoked. More recently, the microservices architectural style has been proposed, where applications are developed as a collection of fine-grained services running as independent processes. Distributed applications can then be constructed from independently deployable services taking advantage of the properties of the microservice architecture (e.g., flexibility, maintainability, reusability, compositionality, and scalability) as well as the elasticity of cloud infrastructure. From the practical point of view, the deployment and maintenance of (micro)services architectures is performed using DevOps, i.e.,  a collection of practices linking software development (Dev) with software operations (Ops). DevOps strongly advocates for automation and monitoring at all steps of software construction, from integration, testing, releasing to deployment and infrastructure management. By using the DevOps methodology, it is possible to reduce the time between committing a change to a system and the change being placed into normal production, while ensuring high quality.<br /><br />
	    The complex scenario of (Micro)Services and DevOps needs to be clarified on many aspects, both from the engineering and from the foundational points of view. From the engineering point of view, there are open issues at many levels. Among others, at the system design level, both traditional approaches based on UML and approaches inspired from business process modelling are used. At the composition level, both the orchestration and choreography views have their supporters. At the description and discovery level, there are two separate communities pushing respectively the semantic approach (e.g., ontologies, OWL) and the syntactic one (e.g., WSDL). At the deployment level, different tools and methodologies are being developed to test, monitor, configure, and strive for always more automatization of the continuous integration and deployment workflows. Finally, features like Quality of Service, security and dependability must be taken seriously into account, and this investigation should lead to standard proposals.<br /><br />
	    From the foundational point of view, researchers have discussed widely in the last years, and many attempts to use formal methods, declarative languages, and optimization tools for the specification, verification and deployment of complex distributed applications. Session correlation, service types, contract theories, communication patterns and configuration optimizers are only a few examples of the aspects that have been investigated. However, most of such approaches concentrate on a few features of Service-Oriented Systems in isolation, and a comprehensive approach is still far from being accomplished.<br /><br />
	    Our track aims to bring together researchers and practitioners having the common objective of transforming Service-Oriented, DevOps, and Microservice practices into a mature discipline with both solid scientific foundations and mature software engineering development methodologies supported by dedicated tools. In particular, we will encourage works and discussions about what (Micro)Services and DevOps still need in order to achieve their goal.<br /><br />

		Authors are invited to submit original unpublished papers. Submission
		of the same paper to multiple tracks is not allowed. Peer groups with
		expertise in the track focus area will <b>double-blindly</b> review submissions.
		This means that authors must omit their names and institutions from the title page,
		they should refer to their other work in the third person and omit acknowledgements that
		could reveal their identity or affiliation.
		The purpose is to avoid any bias based on authors' identity characteristics, such as gender,
		seniority, or nationality, in the review process.
		Our goal is to facilitate an unbiased approach to reviewing by supporting reviewers' access
		to works that do not carry obvious references to the authors' identities.
		Anonymization should not be a heavy burden for authors, and should not make papers weaker
		or more difficult to review.
		Advertising the paper on alternate forums
		(e.g., on a personal web-page, pre-print archive, email, talks, discussions with colleagues)
		is permitted, and authors will not be penalized by for such advertisement.
		Papers not satisfying this constraint will be automatically rejected.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		Accepted papers will be published in the annual
		conference proceedings. MiDOS track chairs will not submit to the
		track. Submissions from MiDOS PC members and from PC members and track
		chairs of other SAC tracks are welcome. Submission guidelines
		can be found on the
		<a href="https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2019/downloads.html" target="_new">SAC 2019 website</a>.
		Prospective papers should be submitted to the track using the provided
		automated submission system.
		See the SAC site for the page constraints.
		For each accepted paper, an author
		or a proxy attending SAC MUST present the paper. This is a requirement
		for the paper to be included in the ACM/IEEE digital library.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		Paper registration is required, allowing the inclusion of the papers, posters, or SRC abstracts in the conference proceedings.
		An author or a proxy attending SAC MUST present the paper. This is a requirement for the presented work to be included in the ACM/IEEE digital library.
		No-show of registered papers, posters, and SRC abstracts will result in excluding them from the ACM/IEEE digital library.

		As before, SAC 2019 organizes a Student Research Competition (SRC)
		Program to provide graduate students the opportunity to meet and

		<br/>
		Submission of the same abstract to multiple tracks is not allowed. 
		All research abstract submissions will be reviewed by researchers 
		and practitioners with expertise in the track focus area to which 
		they are submitted. Authors of selected abstracts will have the 
		opportunity to give poster presentations of their work and compete
		for three top-winning places. The Student Research Competition
		committee will evaluate and select First-, Second-, and Third- place
		winners. The winners will receive cash awards and SIGAPP recognition
		certificates during the conference banquet. Authors of selected
		abstracts are eligible to apply to the SIGAPP Student Travel Award
		program for support.
